# Jobs Portal

The job search website interface is similar to LinkedIn (incomplete and lacks API interaction - no backend).

## Tech

**ReactJS** (TailwindCSS)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). You should consider using Vite as a replacement, or follow the suggestion from the [React homepage](https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project).
